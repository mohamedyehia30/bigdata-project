<h2>Big Data Analytics Lifecycle</h2> 
Big Data analysis varies from conventional data analysis largely because of the data processing rate, velocity and variety characteristics. A step-by - step approach is required to coordinate the activities and tasks involved in collecting, storing , analyzing and repurposing data to meet the distinct criteria for carrying out analysis on Big Data.The following sections are discussing a particular lifecycle of data analytics that organizes and manages the tasks and activities associated with Big Data analysis. From the perspective of Big Data adoption and planning, it is critical that consideration be given to the issues of preparation, education, tooling and staffing of a data analytics team in addition to the lifecycle .<br/>

the Big Data analytics lifecycle can be divided into the following nine stages :<br/>
Business Case Evaluation.<br/>
Data Identification.<br/>
Data Acquisition & Filtering.<br/>
Data Extraction.<br/>
Data Validation & Cleansing.<br/>
Data Aggregation & Representation.<br/>
Data Analysis.<br/>
Data Visualization.<br/>
Utilization of Analysis Results<br/>
