	<h2>big data defination</h2>

Big data is a field that handles methods for systematically analyzing or extracting information or dealing with large or complex data sets that cannot be handled by traditional data-processing application programs.<br/>
Data with many cases (rows) provide greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity ( more attributes or columns) can lead to higher false discovery rates. Big data challenges include data capture, data storage , data analysis, search, sharing, transmission, visualization, querying, updating, data privacy, and source data.<br/>
"There is little doubt that the quantities of data available now are indeed large, but that is not the most relevant feature of this new data ecosystem.  Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to" spot business trends, disease prevention, crime prevention, etc.  Scientists, business executives, practitioners of medicine, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics, connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.<br/>
<h2>The Uses of Big Data</h2>
In order to determine if a correlation exists, data analysts examine the relationship between different types of data, such as demographic and purchase history. Such evaluations can be performed internally within a company or externally by a third party that focuses on processing big data into digestible formats. Businesses frequently use such experts to assess big data to turn it into actionable information.<br/>
Figures from data analysis, from human resources and infrastructure through to marketing and sales can be used by almost any department of a organization. Big data aims to increase the speed at which products are placed on the market, reduce the amount of time and resources needed to gain market adoption, target audiences and ensure customers remain satisfied.<br/>
<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Big Data</h2>
The increase in the amount of available data presents both opportunities and challenges.

Generally speaking, getting more data on one's customers (and potential customers) will allow companies to better target their goods and marketing strategies to generate the highest level of satisfaction and business repeats. Companies capable of gathering large amounts of data are given the opportunity to conduct deeper and richer analysis.<br/>
While a positive thing is better analysis, big data can also create overload and noise. Companies must be able to accommodate greater quantities of data, while assessing which data reflects signals as opposed to noise. A key factor will be determining what makes the data relevant.

In addition , the nature and format of the data may require special handling before they are acted upon. Structured data can be easily stored and sorted, consisting of numeric values. Unstructured data, such as emails, videos, and text documents, may require application of more sophisticated techniques before it becomes useful.
